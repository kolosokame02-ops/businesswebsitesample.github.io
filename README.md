# Wantok Services Ltd — PNG Business Website Template

A clean, mobile‑first website template tailored for businesses in Papua New Guinea.

## Features
- PNG look & feel (Kina, regions, Southern Cross & Kumul motif)
- Pages: Home, About, Services, Projects, Contact
- Responsive, accessible, and fast (no heavy frameworks)
- Easy to host on Netlify, GitHub Pages, or NGINX/Apache
- Placeholder images are SVGs you can replace with your own

## Quick Start
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
3. Edit text, replace placeholder images in `assets/img/`, and customize colours in `assets/css/style.css`.
4. Deploy: upload the folder to your host (Netlify drop, cPanel, or a static bucket).

### PNG Customization Ideas
- Swap colours to your company branding.
- Replace the Kumul/Southern Cross visuals with your logo in `index.html` and `assets/img/favicon.svg`.
- Use `K` for currency in pricing sections.
- Update contact details to your address (NCD, Morobe, ENB, etc.) and PGT time.

## Form Handling
The contact form is static. Options:
- Netlify Forms (works out of the box with `data-netlify="true"`).
- Or change the form `action` to your email API endpoint.
